# Content (Android)

If you want your app to display a NearIT **content** in a pop-up dialog, use this simple code:
```
NearUIDroid.UIContent(<YOUR CONTENT>);
```

Further information on content and other in-app content can be found [here](http://nearit-xamarin-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/android/in-app-content/).

When the user taps on the button, the link will be opened: some types of link will be managed by a specific app, if that app is installed (e.g. a Facebook link).
