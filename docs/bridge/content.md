# Content (PCL)

If you want your app to display a NearIT **content** in a pop-up dialog, use this simple code:
```
NearUIPCL.UIContent(<YOUR XCCONTENT>);
```

Further information on coupons and other in-app content can be found [here](http://nearit-xamarin-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bridge/handle-content/).
