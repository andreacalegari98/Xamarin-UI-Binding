# Coupon (PCL)

If you want your app to display a **coupon** in a beautiful pop-up dialog, use this simple code:

```
NearUIPCL.UICoupon(<YOUR XCCOUPON>);
```

Further information on coupons and other in-app content can be found [here](http://nearit-xamarin-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bridge/handle-content/).
